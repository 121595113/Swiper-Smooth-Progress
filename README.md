Swiper-Smooth-Progress
======================

Smooth Progress plugin for Swiper

Smooth Progress is the ultra small (about 1Kb minified and gzipped) and free JavaScript plugin for iDangero.us Swiper 2.3+ that allows you add additional effects and dependencies depending on current position of Swiper and its slides in real time. The point is that now you can know about how much is far from "active" position any slide.
